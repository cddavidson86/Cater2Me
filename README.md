## The Problem

Cater2me is an app that can span the entirety of the online consumer environment. Our target vertical for launch will be the catering industry. Catering is a niche industry that most consumers don't have experience with until they need it. This creates a market that is hard to approach and often leads to the consumer taking the first offer shot their way.

## Our Solution

Cater2me solves this problem by allowing the consumer to post the details of their events and tell their story just once while receiving multiple quotes and subsequently making an informed decision.  The initial mechanism will involve a user interface and a vendor interface. The user will be required to create an account and from there be able to post an event and it’s details. The vendor will be able to create a profile, post pictures of there food and settings offered, and have rankings/reviews functionality. This will create an interactive consumer environment that maximizes profits for vendors and maximizes convenience for the consumer.
